# AWS Projects

AWS Repo to document AWS project I deploy to my account.

ðŸš€ Goals

- Keep projects repeatable (IaC first), secure (least privilege, encryption, logging), and cheap to run.
- One repo to clone â†’ parameterize â†’ deploy per environment (dev/staging/prod).
- Opinionated patterns (Makefile targets, GitHub Actions, tagging, guardrails) so I donâ€™t have to think.
